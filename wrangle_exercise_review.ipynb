    "As a Codeup data science graduate, you want to show off your skills to the Zillow data science team in hopes of getting an interview for a position you saw pop up on LinkedIn. You thought it might look impressive to build an end-to-end project in which you use some of their Kaggle data to predict property values using some of their available features; who knows, you might even do some feature engineering to blow them away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to predict the values of single unit properties using the obervations from 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these exercises, you will complete the first step toward the above goal: acquire and prepare the necessary Zillow data from the zillow database in the Codeup database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Acquire bedroomcnt, bathroomcnt, calculatedfinishedsquarefeet, taxvaluedollarcnt, yearbuilt, taxamount, and fips from the zillow database for all 'Single Family Residential' properties.\n",
    "1. Using your acquired Zillow data, walk through the summarization and cleaning steps in your wrangle.ipynb file like we did above. You may handle the missing values however you feel is appropriate and meaninful; remember to document your process and decisions using markdown and code commenting where helpful.\n",
    "1. Store all of the necessary functions to automate your process from acquiring the data to returning a cleaned dataframe witn no missing values in your wrangle.py file. Name your final function wrangle_zillow."
